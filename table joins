Write a few sentences on how you approached this query and why. It's important that you can explain your thought process when writing queries,
especially for future interviews. Well, the question asked â€œ what are the top 10 countries for Rockbuster in terms of customer. In order for 
me to come up with a clear answer, I needed to join customer table to address table, address table to the city table, and city table to country 
table for me to able to aggrete the correct data. After we joined all the table, I used the select statement to choose country column. And I 
used the count operator to count all the same customer_id for the countries, and lastly used the group by operator to group the  data by country.

Select Count(Customer_id), city, country
from customer
join address on customer.address_id = address.address_id
join city on address.city_id = city.city_id
join country on city.country_id = country.country_id
Where country in ('India','China','United States', 'Japan', 
				  'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Russian Federation', 
				  'Philippines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
				  Group by city, country
				  Order by count (city) desc
